  the built-in Game Menu, for testing purposes.
* Ability to disable tabs entirely by setting them to Disabled
  within the settings menu.

### Changed
* When there are more than 11 tabs, start creating a second row
  of tabs. This still isn't production ready, but it should be
  by the first public release.
* Change a few log messages from debug to trace severity.

### Fixed
* Make sure to call `emergencyExit()` on the different vanilla
  menu pages when relevant to prevent held items being deleted.

  to ensure that developer tool-tips stay up to date.
