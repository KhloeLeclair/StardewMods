considered part of the license. It is merely my commentary explaining
the current state of the license:


This license is subject to change once I've picked one that preserves my
rights while keeping the software open. Unfortunately, Curseforge decided
that the MIT license meant they could go against my wishes and allow
users to upload my mods on that platform so I had to abandon that.

Other mod developers, please contact me if you're interested in reusing
some of my code. I am generally open to that.
